Given a number and its reverse. Find that number raised to the power of its own reverse.
Note: As answers can be very large, print the result modulo 10^9 + 7.


CODE:
class Solution
{
    long power(int N,int R)
    {
        long result = 1;
        long base = N;
        int modulo = 1000000007;

        while (R > 0) {
            if (R % 2 == 1) {
                result = (result * base) % modulo;
            }
            base = (base * base) % modulo;
            R /= 2;
        }

        return result;

        
    }

}
