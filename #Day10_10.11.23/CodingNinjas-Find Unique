You have been given an integer array/list(ARR) of size N. Where N is equal to [2M+1].
Now, in the given array/list, 'M' numbers are present twice and one number is present only once. You need to find and return that number which is unique in the array/list.
Note:Unique element is always present in the array/list according to the given condition.


CODE:
import java.util.Deque;
import java.util.ArrayDeque;

public class Solution{  

    public static int findUnique(int[] arr)
    {
        Deque<Integer>res = new ArrayDeque<>();
        for(int i = 0 ; i < arr.length ; i ++)
        {
          int c = arr[i];
            if (res.contains(c)) {
                res.remove(c);
            } else {
                res.add(c);
            }
        }
        return res.peek();
        
    }
}
