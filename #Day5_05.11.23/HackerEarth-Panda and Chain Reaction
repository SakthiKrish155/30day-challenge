Panda has become a scientist recently. In his laboratory, there are infinite number of chambers where a chamber number K is connected to a chamber number K-1.
The numbering of chambers start from 0. Initially, X number of particles are present in the chamber number 0. The number of particles present in chamber K is
K times the number of particles present in chamber K-1. You are supposed to help Panda in finding out the number of particles in a given chamber number N.
Note: The number of particles in chamber K cannot be calculated until the number of particles in chamber K-1 are calculated.


CODE:
import java.util.Scanner;
class TestClass 
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        int c = 1000003;
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int t = sc.nextInt();
        for(int i = 0 ; i < t ; i ++)
        {
            int n , x;
            n = sc.nextInt();
            x = sc.nextInt();
            int arr[] = new int[n+1];
            arr[0] = x;
            for(int k = 1 ; k < n+1 ; k ++)
            {
               arr[k] = k * arr[k-1];
            }
            int result = arr[n]%c;
            System.out.println(result);
        }
    }
}
