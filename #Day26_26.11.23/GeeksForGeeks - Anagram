Given two strings a and b consisting of lowercase characters. The task is to check whether two given strings are an anagram of each
other or not. An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different. 
For example, act and tac are an anagram of each other.


CODE:
class Solution
{    
    //Function is to check whether two strings are anagram of each other or not.
    public static boolean isAnagram(String a,String b)
    {
        if(a.length() != b.length())
            return false;
        char s[] = a.toCharArray();
        char t[] = b.toCharArray();
        int flag = 0;
        Arrays.sort(s);
        Arrays.sort(t);
        return Arrays.equals(s,t);
    }
}
