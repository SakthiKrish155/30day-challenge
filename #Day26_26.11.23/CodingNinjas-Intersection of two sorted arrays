You are given two arrays 'A' and 'B' of size 'N' and 'M' respectively. Both these arrays are sorted in non-decreasing order. You have to find the intersection of these two arrays.
Intersection of two arrays is an array that consists of all the common elements occurring in both arrays.Note:
1. The length of each array is greater than zero.
2. Both the arrays are sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. The output should be in the order of elements that occur in the original array=
4. If there is no intersection present then return an empty array.


CODE:
import java.util.* ;
import java.io.*; 
public class Solution
{
	public static ArrayList<Integer> findArrayIntersection(ArrayList<Integer> arr1, int n, ArrayList<Integer> arr2, int m)
	{
        ArrayList <Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
         int i = 0, j = 0;

         while (i < n && j < m) 
         {
            if (arr1.get(i) < arr2.get(j)) 
            {
                i++;
            } 
            else if (arr1.get(i) > arr2.get(j)) 
            {
                j++;
            }
            else 
            {
                result.add(arr1.get(i));
                i++;
                j++;
            }
        }

        return result;
	}
}
