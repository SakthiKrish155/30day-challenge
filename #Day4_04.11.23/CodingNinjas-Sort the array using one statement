You have been given an integer array/list(ARR) of size 'N'. It only contains Os, 1s and 2s. Write a solution to sort this array/list.
Note:Try to solve the problem in 'Single Scan'.'Single Scan' refers to iterating over the array/list just once or to put it in other words, 
you will be visiting each element in the array/list just once.


CODE:
import java.util.* ;
import java.io.*; 
public class Solution 
{
    public static void sort012(int[] arr)
    {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        
    }
}
