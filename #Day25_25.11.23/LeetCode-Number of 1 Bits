Write a function that takes the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).


CODE:
public class Solution 
{
    public int hammingWeight(int n) 
    {
        int count = 0;
        String str = Integer.toBinaryString(n);
        for(int i = 0 ; i < str.length() ; i ++)
        {
            if(str.charAt(i) == '1')
                count ++;

        }
        return count;
    }
}
