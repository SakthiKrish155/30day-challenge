You are given a string 'str' of length 'N'.Your task is to reverse the original string word by word.
There can be multiple spaces between two words and there can be leading or trailing spaces but in the output reversed string 
you need to put a single space between two words, and your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.


CODE:
public class Solution 
{
	public static String reverseString(String str) 
	{
		String words[] = str.split("\\s+");
		StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
		for(int i = words.length-1 ; i >= 0 ; i --)
		{
			sb.append(words[i]);
			if(i > 0)
				sb.append(" ");
		}
		return sb.toString();
	}
}
