You are given an array 'ARR' of size 'N' containing each number between 1 and 'N' - 1 at least once.
There is a single integer value that is present in the array twice. Your task is to find the duplicate integer value present in the array. 
For example:Consider ARR = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4], the duplicate integer value present in the array is 4. Hence, the answer is 4 in this case.
Note:A duplicate number is always present in the given array.


CODE:
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashSet;

public class Solution {

	public static int findDuplicate(ArrayList<Integer> arr) 
	{
		int value = 0;
		HashSet<Integer>res = new HashSet<>();
		for(int i = 0 ; i < arr.size() ; i ++)
		{
			if(res.contains(arr.get(i)))
			{
				value = arr.get(i);
			}
			res.add(arr.get(i));
		}
		return value;
	}
}
