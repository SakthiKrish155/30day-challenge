You are given two strings of equal lengths, s1 and s2. The task is to check if s2 is a rotated version of the string s1.


CODE:
class Solution
{
    public static boolean areRotations(String s1, String s2 )
    {
            if (s1.length() != s2.length()) 
                return false; 
             String concatenated = s1 + s1;
             return concatenated.contains(s2);
    }
    
}
