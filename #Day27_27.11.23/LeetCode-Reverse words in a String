Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. 
The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.


CODE:
class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) 
    {
        StringBuilder ans = new StringBuilder();
        String arr[] = s.trim().split("\\s+");

        for (int i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            ans.append(arr[i]);
            if (i != 0) {
                ans.append(" ");
            }
        }

        return ans.toString();
    }
}
