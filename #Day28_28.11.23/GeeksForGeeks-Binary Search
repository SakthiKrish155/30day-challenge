Given a sorted array of size N and an integer K, find the position(0-based indexing) at which K is present in the array using binary search.


CODE:
class Solution {
    int binarysearch(int arr[], int n, int k) 
    {
        int low = 0;
        int high = n-1;
        while(low <= high)
        {
            int mid = low + (high-low)/2;
            if(arr[mid] == k)
                return mid;
            else if(arr[mid] < k)
                low = mid + 1;
            else
                high = mid - 1;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
